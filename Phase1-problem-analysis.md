# Phase 1: Full Project Analysis

This document completes the initial discovery and planning phase. It includes an analysis of the key stakeholders, a mapping of business processes, and an exploration of potential AppExchange solutions.



### 1. Requirement Gathering
1. Client Information
We need a complete view of every client to provide personalized service. We will use the standard Salesforce Contact object for this.

Required Fields:

Email (Standard) - For sending email confirmations.

Mailing Address (Standard) - Optional, for marketing.

Client Notes (Custom Field) - A rich text field to store important preferences, allergy information, or color formulas.

2. Service Information
We need a price book of all services the salon offers. We will use the standard Salesforce Product object for this, treating each service as a product.

Required Fields:

Service Name (Standard Product Name) - e.g., "Men's Haircut", "Full Color", "Manicure".

Service Description (Standard) - Details about the service.

Standard Price (Standard Price Book) - The cost of the service.

Duration (Minutes) (Custom Field) - A number field indicating how long the service takes (e.g., 30, 90). This is critical for scheduling.

Each staff member needs a profile and a schedule. We will use the standard Salesforce User object.

Final Price (Currency Field) - The final amount charged, which could be different from the standard price.

Appointment Notes (Text Area) - Notes specific to this visit.

### 2. Stakeholder Analysis

A stakeholder is anyone who has an interest in the project's success. For the Glamour Salon, we have three primary stakeholders.

| Stakeholder Role | Name (Example) | Their Primary Goal | What They Need from the System |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Salon Owner** | Jane Reid | Grow the business, increase profit, and ensure smooth operations. | High-level dashboards, sales reports, and staff performance metrics. |
| **Receptionist** | Sam Kumar | Manage the schedule efficiently, avoid booking errors, and handle client check-ins quickly. | An easy-to-use calendar, quick access to client information, and a simple booking process. |
| **Stylist** | Priya Singh | Provide excellent service and build client relationships. | Access to their daily schedule and client-specific notes (preferences, formulas). |

### 3. Business Process Mapping

This section outlines the salon's current manual processes ("As-Is") and how they will be improved with the new Salesforce system ("To-Be").

#### **Process: Booking a New Appointment**

| As-Is (Current Manual Process) | To-Be (Future Salesforce Process) |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1. Client calls the salon. | 1. Receptionist opens the Salesforce console. |
| 2. Receptionist puts client on hold. | 2. Searches for the client by name/phone. |
| 3. Manually flips through the paper diary. | 3. Views the dynamic calendar to see availability. |
| 4. Finds an empty slot and shouts to check if the stylist is free. | 4. Selects the client, service, stylist, and time slot on a single screen. |
| 5. Writes the client's name in pencil. | 5. Clicks "Save." An `Appointment` record is created. |
| **Outcome:** Slow, error-prone, no reminders. | **Outcome:** Fast, accurate, and an automated SMS/email reminder can be sent. |

#### **Process: Viewing a Client's History**

| As-Is (Current Manual Process) | To-Be (Future Salesforce Process) |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1. Stylist tries to remember the client's last visit. | 1. Stylist opens the Salesforce mobile app or views the appointment details. |
| 2. Asks the client, "What did we do last time?" | 2. Clicks on the client's name. |
| 3. Relies on memory for color formulas or preferences. | 3. Instantly sees all past appointments, services, and notes under the client's `Contact` record. |
| **Outcome:** Inconsistent service, risk of losing important details. | **Outcome:** Personalized, high-quality service every time. |



### 4. Industry-Specific Use Case Analysis

This section analyzes unique processes for the beauty and wellness industry that our Salesforce system must handle.

**Use Case 1: Complex Client Data**
* **Industry Need:** Unlike a standard retail customer, a salon client has technical data that is crucial for consistent service. This includes hair color formulas, allergy notes, and treatment preferences.
* **Salesforce Solution:** We will create a custom rich-text field called `Client Technical Notes` on the `Contact` object. This allows stylists to record detailed, formatted notes (e.g., "Color Formula: 30g BrandX 5.1 + 30g 6% developer") that are permanently and securely stored on the client's record.

**Use Case 2: Duration-Based Scheduling**
* **Industry Need:** Salon services are not all the same length. A simple one-hour calendar slot is not practical. A haircut might take 30 minutes, while a color treatment could take 3 hours.
* **Salesforce Solution:** We will add a custom `Duration (Minutes)` field to our `Product` (Service) object. When an appointment is booked, our scheduling system will use this field to calculate the appointment's end time, ensuring the stylist's calendar is blocked for the correct amount of time and preventing double-bookings.

**Use Case 3: Client Rebooking & Retention**
* **Industry Need:** The most profitable salon clients are returning clients. The period immediately after a service is the best time to secure the next booking.
* **Salesforce Solution:** We will design a "Check-Out" Screen Flow. When a receptionist marks an appointment as "Completed," this flow will automatically pop up, displaying the client's details and a button that says "Book Next Appointment." It can even pre-calculate the date for 6 weeks in the future, making it incredibly easy for the receptionist to secure a follow-up visit.
