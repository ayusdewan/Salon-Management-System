1. The Problem
Many salons still use a paper appointment book and a cash box to run their business. When the salon is not busy, this works fine. But as the business grows, this old way of doing things starts to cause problems:

Booking Mistakes Happen: It's easy to accidentally double-book a client or write down the wrong time in a paper diary. It's also not easy for clients to book an appointment, as they always have to call the salon.

Forgetting Client Details: Salons don't have an easy way to remember what a client likes, such as their favorite services or color formula. This makes it hard to give a personal and high-quality service every time.

Managing Staff is Hard Work: Figuring out which staff member is working, when they are free, and calculating their pay at the end of the month takes a lot of time.

Hard to See the Big Picture: The salon owner can't easily see which days are the busiest, which services make the most money, or how well the business is doing overall. This makes it difficult to plan and grow the business.

2. The Solution
This Salon Management System will fix these problems by giving salons one simple tool to manage everything.

Core Features:
Easy Booking: A simple calendar to book, change, or cancel appointments. It will also send automatic reminders to clients.

Know Your Clients: A place to save client contact info and their service history, so the salon can always offer a personalized experience.

Manage Staff and Services: A simple way to create staff schedules and list all the services the salon offers with their prices.

Track Your Success: A dashboard that shows the owner important information like daily sales and most popular services, helping them make smart decisions for their business.
